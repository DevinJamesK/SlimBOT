<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to SlimBOT.</h3>

<p>I had wanted to create an IRC Bot written in python as a learning experience but really didn't know where to start. While searching the web I soon realized that there were no simple IRC Bot "blueprints" around.  After reading some of the basics online I decided to write what I had been looking for in the first place and share it with others who might be interested, SlimBOT is now that project. Some might look at this code and think that it’s pretty basic, well, that’s the point. I want anyone who is new to programming, or perhaps just Python, to be able to look at this code and get the jest of what it’s doing. There is something truly awesome about being able to completely grasp something simple and then built it into something complex and powerful and in many ways having something that’s simple but works well is awesome.</p>

<h3>
<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To Use SlimBOT</h3>

<p>You can either clone the project file using git (the fun way) or you can simple download it using the links above (the easy way) and then continue with the instructions below.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd desired_folder_for_project
$ git clone https://github.com/DevinJamesK/SlimBOT
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have (cloned / downloaded and decompressed) the project you will have to open the SlimBOT.py file in an editor of your choice and change the fields needed (it is heavly documented).  After all of that, assuming you have permissions, run it.  Feel free to mess with it all you like and even push me your great ideas!</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Updates</h3>

<p>I work on this project often and try to add something new and creative every week while at the same time trying not to complicate things too much. Be sure to pull often!</p>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Tools I Use...</h3>

<p>SlimBOT is written in Python 2.7 with the PyCharm IDE.  Yeah I know, the IDE doesn’t have much to do with the code itself but I like it so much I wanted to give it some support.  It’s free for the community edition, great for noobs to experts, and can be found on the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="user-mention">PyCharm Site</a>.</p>
