SlimBOT
=======

SlimBOT is a simple IRC Bot written in Python for people who want to learn more about IRC, Python, and programming in general.

BACKGROUND
===========

I had wanted to create an IRC Bot written in python as a learning experience but really didn't know where to start.  While searching the web I soon realized that there were no simple IRC Bot "blueprints" around.  After reading some of the basics online I decided to write what I had been looking for in the first place and share it with others who might be interested, SlimBOT is now that project.  Some might look at this code and think that it’s pretty basic, well, that’s the point.  I want anyone who is new to programming, or perhaps just Python, to be able to look at this code and get the jest of what it’s doing.  There is something truly awesome about being able to completely grasp something simple and then built it into something complex and powerful and in many ways having something that’s simple but works well is awesome.

UPDATES
========

I work on this project often and try to add something new and creative every week while at the same time trying not to complicate things too much. 

TOOLS I USE
==========

SlimBOT is written in Python 2.7 with the PyCharm IDE.  Yeah I know, the IDE doesn’t have much to do with the code itself but I like it so much I wanted to give it some support.  It’s free for the community edition, great for noobs to experts, and can be found at http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
